## 1. Introduction

Metabolomics is becoming an increasingly popular tool for biological research, however while individual studies may identify certain results, such results may not be reproducible in other independent studies of the same biological questions due to low sample size, sample heterogeneity, the type of LC-MS platform used, or metrics used for interpreting results. Meta-analysis, which is the combination of findings from independent studies - can be used to overcome such limitations and ultimately increase the power, precision, and generalizability of a study.

```

With the increased use of metabolomics and global efforts towards science transparency, the amount of publicly available metabolomics data deposited in dedicated metabolomics repositories such as Metabolomics Workbench, MetaboLights and OmicsDI has grown tremendously. The potential for researchers in the metabolomics community to enhance their findings with publicly available data is immense, but little effort has been applied for the meta-analysis of untargeted metabolomics data. Such a method would also reduce the bias individual studies may carry towards specific sample processing protocols or LC-MS instruments. 

### 1.1 The Mummichog Algorithm ###

High-resolution LC-MS has become dominant platform for global metabolomics. The typical LC-MS workflow starts with data acquisition, followed by data pre-processing, feature selection, compound identification and then pathway analysis. However, peak identification requires significant efforts and is a major challenge for downstream functional interpretation. One strategy is to completely bypass bottleneck of metabolite identification and directly infer functional activity from MS peaks by leveraging the collective knowledge of metabolic pathways and networks. This is the idea of the mummichog algorithm. Essentially what happens here is that a list of significant peaks, for instance 105.814 m/z is matched to potential compounds considering different adducts/isotopes (Figure 2). 

```{r fig2, echo=F, fig.align="center", fig.cap="\\label{fig2}Figure 2. List of significant peaks mapped onto a metabolic network."}
knitr::include_graphics("vignette_figures/meta_mum/mum_sig.png", dpi = 150)
```

These putatively matched compounds are then mapped onto known biological pathways. If a list of truly significant features reflect biological activity, then the representation of these true metabolites would be enriched on functional structures (Figure 2), while false matches would be distributed at random (Figure 3). We have extended this idea to support the meta-analysis of untargeted metabolomics data.

knitr::include_graphics("vignette_figures/meta_mum/mum_random.png", dpi = 150)
```

### 1.2 The metaMZ Workflow ###

Overall, the metaMZ workflow supports meta-analysis at either a) the pathway level or b) the compound/empirical compound level. Each level of integration has their own merits, for instance at the pathway level, compounds do not have to be matched across all studies, whereas the compound-level integration is better at bringing out weaker signals. The workflow also considers data heterogeneity, meaning that the accuracy of the LC-MS instrument and the MS ionization mode are all taken into account when performing putative metabolite annotation. Ultimately, the goal of this workflow is to enable the reuse/repurposong of multiple datasets to identify a robust meta-signature for the phenotype in question. 

One of the bottlenecks for meta-analysis of untargeted metabolomics studies is the heterogeneity in the sample processing, instrumentation used, and even samples themselves that make it difficult to directly compare studies. Another significant hurdle is that unlike targeted metabolomics where a single metabolite can be quantified, in untargeted metabolomics data each metabolite can be linked to multiple peaks, each with their own expression levels. The approach we have adopted is to therefore combine p-values, effect sizes, or both from all peaks across all studies linked to that metabolite to obtain an overall significance level for that metabolite.

The metaMZ workflow supports the use of the original mummichog algorithm, the GSEA algorithm, or both ("integ") to perform the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis can be performed by combining the statistical significance of proposed metabolites before pathway analysis (compound/empirical compound level), or after individual pathway analysis.  

#### 1.2.1 Workflow for Compound/Empirical Compound-Level Meta-Analysis #### 

Using the compound or empirical compound meta-analysis, it will first perform the putative peak annotation on each individual study (Figure 2). Next, the peak annotations are united by default, meaning that only the compounds/empirical compounds found across all studies are kept. Note users can change this parameter using the mutual.feats = FALSE in the performMetaPSEA function. Next, the list of significant features are updated (see below).  

```{r fig4, echo=F, fig.align="center", fig.cap="\\label{fig4}Figure 4. Workflow for compound or empirical compound-level meta-analysis."}
knitr::include_graphics("vignette_figures/meta_mum/compound_integration.png", dpi = 650)
```

For the mummichog algorithm and "integ" options, a list of significant features are required. Therefore the next step is to combine m/z level statistics across all studies for each compound/empirical compound to obtain the unified list of significant features. Users can either integrate p-values (as if from a T-test), effect sizes, or both to select which m/z features should be used as input (Figure 3). This list is then used as input for pathway activity prediction.

```{r fig5, echo=F, fig.align="center", fig.cap="\\label{fig5}Figure 5. Workflow for how the unified list of significant features are created."}
knitr::include_graphics("vignette_figures/meta_mum/sig_feats_metamum.png", dpi = 150)
```

#### 1.2.2 Workflow for Pathway-Level Meta-Analysis #### 

For the pathway-level meta-analysis, each study undergoes the typical steps of calculating m/z level statistics (if not already done), putative metabolite annotation, followed by pathway activity prediction. Once this is complete for all studies, all pathway results are combined to create a unified matrix of pathway-level results (keeping only pathways found across all-studies). Pathway activity scores are then combined using one of several p-value integration methods (see Section 1.2.3).

```{r fig6, echo=F, fig.align="center", fig.cap="\\label{fig6}Figure 6. Workflow for pathway-level meta-analysis."}
knitr::include_graphics("vignette_figures/meta_mum/pathway_integration.png", dpi = 150)
```

#### 1.2.3 When to use Compound-Level/Emprirical-Compound Level or Pathway-Level Integration?

Pathway-level integration should be used when the studies are independent of eachother - meaning they were performed using different LC-MS instruments, using different extraction methods etc. This is because while lists of features from multiple independent studies looking at the same disease often have little overlap, the use of pathway analysis improves the biological consistency across studies (PMID: 20410053). Towards this, the Pathway-level integration does not require that compounds be matched across all studies. 

In comparison, the Compound or Empirical-Compound level integration should be used when the data are more homogeneous, for instance data comes from the same lab but different batches or different columns on the same samples and the same instrument. By default, the algorithm will keep only compounds that match across all studies - for instance if the datasets were all the same column, same phenotype in question, same instrument, we would only want to focus on compounds that are merried by all datasets. However, if we had different columns but the same samples, then we would want to keep all putative compounds/empirical compounds for predicting pathway activity. An example of this case will be shown in the case study below.

#### 1.2.4 Combining P-Values ####

The metaMZ framework supports various methods for p-value combination, including Fisher's, Edgington's, Stouffer's, Vote Count, Minimum P-value or Maximum P-value. The choice of statistical method depends on the goal of the meta-analysis as well as the data structure itself. Briefly, Fisher's statistic, the Minimum P-value or Maximum P-value are traditionally used methods for combining p-values. 

The **Fisher's method** is known to be more sensitive than other methods to very small (or very large) p-values which can result in a high false positive rate. For instance, a single very small p-value can lead to a significant combined p-value. "Fisherâ€™s method employs the log product of individual P-values and thus, a single P-value of zero in one individual case will result in a combined P-value of zero regardless of the other P-values." - (PMID: 26471455). This method should be followed when the data follows a Chi-squared distribution (positive values). It is also not recommended for use for meta-analysis with >5 datasets (http://bioinfo.genyo.es/imageo/). 

The **Minimum P-value** should be used to answer the question which metabolites are changed across at least one study? In this case, the minimum p-value among all studies is taken as the combined p-value.

The **Maximum P-value** is the most restrictive method and should be used to answer the question of which genes are consistently changed across all studies? In this case, the maximum p-value among all studies is taken as the combined p-value.

**Stouffer's method** attributes different weights to the p-values when combining them in a meta-analysis. This method should be applied when the data follows a Gaussian curve. Not as sensitive as Fisher's to very small or very large p-values.

**Edgington's method** uses the sum of the p-values and unlike Fisher's method, is not sensisitve to small p-values. It best fits circular data and it has been noted that using this method, a single large p-value can overwhelm small p-values (PMID: 11788962).   

The **vote counting** method is limited to answering the question is there any evidence of an effect? One issue with this method is that it compares the number of "yes" studies to the number of "no" studies. The "yes" and "no" if often an arbitrary statistical cutoff that can bias the outcome. Secondly, it does not apply any weights to the studies, therefore the effect of a study with 1000 samples has the same weight as a study with 10 samples. While this method is simple to implement and interpret, this method should only be used when standard meta-analysis methods cannot be used.

#### 1.2.4 Combining Effect Sizes ####

  The effect size is a way to quantify the strength of the difference of phenotype in question between two groups. One of the most recommended methods for calculating the effect size is the Hedge's g. This method controls for bias in small studies to overestimate the effect. Cohen's d. To combine the effect sizes across the studies, there are two possible methods: 1) the fixed effects model or 2) the random effects model. 

The **fixed effects model** is a linear model that assumes that the different studies share an underlying common true effect and that observed differences are due to sampling error. This model should therefore be used when the datasets are rather homogeneous (e.g. samples come from the same population). 

In comparison, the **random effects model** assumes that the true effect size follows a distribution, and hence is different between different studies. The random effects model is more commonly used as data are more likely to be heterogeneous (e.g. different LC-MS platform used or batch effects). A fixed effects model will select genes with the strongest effects amongst the studies, while random effects models will select genes with the strongest average effect across the studies.

### 1.3 metaMZ Case Study

To showcase the metaMZ workflows, we will use a subset of COVID-19 metabolomics data from our recently submitted manuscript investigating the pathogenesis of COVID-19 (Pang, Chong, Zhou and Xia, 2020, Metabolites, In Submission).

#### 1.3.1 Pathway-Level Integration

To perform pathway-level integration, we will use a subset of 3 metabolomics datasets obtained using high-resolution LC-MS collected from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls in the United States of America. First, we will read in each dataset individually. Note that the same algorithm (mummichog original, GSEA or both) must be identical across all studies. Second, note the object metaFiles that gets created, containing the names of the read in datasets saved as individual .qs files. These .qs files will be created in your current working directory using the savePeakListMetaData.

Following this, to perform the meta-analysis, use the performMetaPSEA function. Using this function, specify the name of the library you wish to use, the version of the library (if KEGG), the number of permtutations, the level of integration (pathway/compound/empirical compound), how the data should be integrated (using p-value, effect-size or both), the method for p-value integration and finally the method for effect-size integration.

```

Finally, there are three supported options to visualize the pathway-level meta-analysis results using the PlotPathwayMetaAnalysis function. First is a heatmap, where the p-values for each study are plotted along with the meta-p-value (Figure 7). Second is a network view, where each node represents a pathway, the size representing the number of pathways in which the study was significant and the color corresponding to the meta-p-value (Figure 8). The ggraph R package is required for creating the network plots. Last is the bubble plot, where each circle represents the p-value for that pathway in an individual study (Figure 9). The size of the node corresponds to the enrichment ratio and the color to the p-value. Note that all plots can be made interactive, using the plotly and visNetwork R packages.

#### 1.3.2 Compound-Level Integration

Here, we have two datasets from the same study, however the first is the negative column and the second is the positive column. Because they are from the same samples, we can set the mutual.feats to FALSE to keep all putative compound identifications for pathway activity prediction. To visualize the meta-analysis results, use the PlotMSPeaksCpdEcpdNetwork function. Using this function a network will be plotted, with nodes representing the pathways/metabolite sets. The color of the nodes would represent the p-value and two nodes would be linked if they share more than 25% of compounds (set by default, users can change this parameter).
